/*
WEB_SHARED.H

The state the page (port/web/site/app.js, on the browser's main thread)
shares with the game (a pthread, in a Web Worker) through the WebAssembly
memory. The page finds it with web_shared_state() and reads and writes it
through typed arrays at the offsets below: every member is a 32-bit word,
so the layout is the same on both sides.

- events: keyboard, mouse and focus events, a ring the page writes and
  SDL_PollEvent reads (web_sdl.c);
- gamepads: the state of up to WEB_GAMEPAD_COUNT controllers (the page
  polls the Gamepad API each animation frame; the touch controls are one
  more controller);
- display: the size of the page's canvas in device pixels, and a counter
  the page advances each animation frame, which paces the game's frames;
- audio: a ring of interleaved stereo float samples the game's mixer
  fills and the page's AudioWorklet plays.
